EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:<br/>
The company name is AS <br/>
The company job is about IT solution <br/>
Its target is stay in the competition among other companies by analyzing data to help identify future skill requirements <br/>
It would to improve the programming languages and database choices <br/>
Its experience is about 8 years in IT solution <br/>
INTRODUCTION : <br/>
Understand the factors that effect on programming languages usage <br/>
What are the most programming languages used this year and next year <br/>
What are the most Database ﻿Worked With  this year and next year <br/>
What are the most Platform Worked With  this year and next year <br/>
What are the most Web Frame Worked With  this year and next year <br/>
METHODOLOGY : <br/>
Data was collected and cleaned then they was input into excel spreadsheets in csv format. The excel spreadsheet files were uploaded into IBM Cognos Dashboard. such as  Language Worked With, were graphed and analyzed using the tools in IBM Cognos Dashboard. The focus of this analysis was to observe Programming Language Trends, Database Trends, the most popular web frames, the most popular platforms, and how the respondent count differed based upon gender, age, location, and education level. <br/>
RESULTS : <br/>
PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE TRENDS: <br/>
Current Year: <br/>

PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE TRENDS - FINDINGS & IMPLICATIONS:<br/>
Findings : <br/>
The  5 Top languages  this year in order: <br/>
JavaScript,Html/css,SQL,Bash/Shell/PowerShell,Python <br/> 
The most popular language this 
Year is JavaScript <br/>
The fifth popular language this 
Year is TypeScript <br/> 
There is a big difference between the first and fifth language this year  <br/>
Implications : <br/>
The  5 Top languages  next year in order: <br/>
JavaScript,Html/css, Python ,SQL,TypeScript <br/>
The most and second popular language trend remain the same next year(JavaScript, Html/css) <br/>
Bash/Shell/PowerShell will not remain one of the top 5 language next year <br/>
Python will grow up to the third popular language next year <br/>
DATABASE TRENDS: <br/>
Current Year: <br/>

Next Year : <br/>

DATABASE TRENDS - FINDINGS & IMPLICATIONS: <br/>
Findings : <br/>
The  5 Top Databases  this year in order: MySQL,Microsoft SQL Server,PostgreSQL,SQLLite,MonogeDB <br/>
The most popular Database this 
Year is MySQL <br/> 
The fifth popular Database this 
Year is TypeScript MonogeDB <br/> 
There is a big difference between the first and fifth Database this year <br/>
Implications : <br/>
The  5 Top Databases  next year in order: PostgreSQL, MonogeDB, Redis,MySQL, Elasticsearch <br/> 
The most popular Database will not stay the same next year it will be PostgreSQL and this means this Database will grow up from third database to the first
MySQL will go down to the third Database and MonogeDB will grow up to the second Database <br/>  
Microsoft SQL Server and SQLLite will not stay among the top 5 <br/>  
Redis and Elasticsearch will grow up to the top 5 Databases <br/>

DISCUSSION : <br/>
We saw in this study there is a trend to the big data  in the future so will be accreditation  on the advanced programming language so we will see the difference in usage and results in the future <br/>
OVERALL FINDINGS & IMPLICATIONS : <br/>
Findings: <br/>
The usage in programming languages trend for advanced <br/>
The usage in Databases trend for non –relational databases <br/>
Implications : 
The companies and programmer go to the advanced languages that support the easy learning and more relation with the development in Labour market trends <br/>
The companies and programmer go to big data and warehouse because of the increase in interest of data  <br/>
CONCLUSION: <br/>
To collect the data we used accessing APIs and web scraping <br/>
The top programming language change by demand <br/>
The top Database change by demand <br/>
